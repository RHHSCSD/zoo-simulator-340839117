/**
 * THINKING QUESTIONS:
 *
 * Sub-classes of the waterAnim, landAnim, and birdAnim could be created in
 * which each animal is classed in the predator or prey category. Since you
 * would have many prey and many predator classes, an interface for predator and
 * one for prey could be created and all the appropriate subclasses could
 * implement it. The predator class could include methods such as hunt() which
 * could cause the predator to search for and attack a prey animal. Prey could
 * have a counter method such as evade() where they hide from the predator.
 * Perhaps each predator could have an aggression field to control how often it
 * attacks prey. Similarly, prey could have an awareness variable that if high
 * enough allows them to evade capture from the predator. To implement diet
 * types, a simple field within the animal class could specify the animalâ€™s diet
 * (Carnivore, Omnivore or Herbivore). Then, types of food (meat, veggie, grain,
 * etc.) could be implemented and the animal would require different food based
 * on diet. If a predator-type animal kills a prey-type animal (or any animal
 * kills any animal) the animal could be replaced with a meat-type food so that
 * the predator can then consume the prey.
